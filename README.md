# Estimating-Cosmos-using-Redshift

I've developed a model using Supervised learning algorthms. The model classify the SpaceObject into 3 classes GALAXY, STARS, Quasars and
calculate the distance of the spaceobject from earth in Redshift. 

The dataset is collected from SDSS.org and it consists of 5 million data points which is 100 Megabytes on the disk. The orginal data is around 27 TB
